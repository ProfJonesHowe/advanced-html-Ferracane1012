<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello Everyone!
My name is Danielle, I am a returning college student. I grew up in a small town in Syracuse, New York. I have attended Herkimer County Community College and Hartwick College. Before having my children, I previously worked as a preschool teacher. I had a passion of teaching young minds. Which brought me to want the opportunity to raising my children and have there undivided attention. I was blessed to be a stay at home mother of my two boys. It was very rewarding to be a part of nurturing them and managing a busy household.
Now, that they are growing older. I believe that education is a lifelong journey and I would like to pursue a career in computers/technology. I have decided to expand my love of learning and explore a different avenue. I am majoring in Cybersecurity. Watching my brother have a thriving career in cyber really sparked my curiosity and interest. I am eager to expand my knowledge and learn all the aspects of computers/technology and how they work.
One topic that interest me in informatics is AI and how it effects our future.  Looking forward, AI will likely have a large impact on society and be beneficial.  AI has potential to facilitate solving challenges and achieve more.  It will make strategies easier and efficient. Coupled together it will assist in helping us and overall improve our future using AI. Data Privacy and Security and Human Computer Interaction are some topics that catch my interest as well.
Fun fact: I recently traveled to Ireland and London..my first time traveling internationally! I am currently looking for more places to travel to! One of the places I just visited was the Blarney Castle in Ireland. I even kissed the Blarney stone upside down! It is importation to me because it was always my dream to travel. I finally am able to start the journey of adventures and to explore all the places that interest me.  
My favorite activities: are spending time with my two boys. They are always keeping me on my toes. They keep me very busy driving them all over for sports. I love attending their games and watching them play. I also love working out and cooking!
My best quality is Resilience. I can overcome any challenge and setbacks quickly. Becoming a stronger every time. Learning and growing from those experiences. Gaining a deeper understanding of myself. My worst quality, I have a hard time delegating work and asking for help. I try to always to everything on my own. Collaborating with others would help with efficiency and better results.
